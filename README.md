In Test bench,
* All initial begins are run parallely.
* Inside the initial begin line by line execution happen

* Logic Keyword have 4 state --> have advantage over bit type; we can see errors
    - 1
    - 0
    - x --> Undefined value
    - z --> High Impedance

* Bit Keyword have only two stages
    - 1
